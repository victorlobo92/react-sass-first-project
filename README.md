# React with SASS
This is my first project using React with SASS

## Pre requirements
- Docker
- Docker-compose

## How to start
1. Clone this project
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/victorlobo92/react-sass-first-project.git
  ```
2. Access the project folder:
  ```
  cd react-sass-first-project
  ```
3. Execute the setup env script (this will set your `.env` file with the necessary environment variables):
  ```
  source ./setup-env.sh
  ```
4. Start the application:
  ```
  docker-compose up
  ```

The setup will bring the application up and running with hot loader.

You are good to go! Awesome coding!
